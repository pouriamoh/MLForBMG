Predicting flow curve of bulk metallic glasses with the aid of machine learning models.
In this project we used ensemble models to predict flow curve and by using the predicted values we could study the deformation behavior of BMGs within the supercooled liquid region.
There are some python files that could be useful for calculating some properties of bulk metallic glasses.
